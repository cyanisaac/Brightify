*Dates presented are when the tweak code for a version was finished, and may
not reflect the release date on BigBoss.*

## v0.3 (4/12/17)
* Added the ability to disable Noctis integration.
* More bugfixes. At this point, not everything looks good, but everything should
be usable. I plan on introducing an improved color scheme for 1.0.
* Better repository info files.

Please note that this project is not going to have updates for a few months
due to school projects, unless someone else wishes to pick up the tweak and
contribute code.
