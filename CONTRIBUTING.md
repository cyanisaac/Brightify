# Contributing
Thank you for your decision to contribute to Brightify! Contributions are
always welcome, and I'm glad that you've decided to help make Brightify better!

What follows is a short guide on what you need to be aware of when contributing.

## Copyright/Licensing
While my tweak is under the GPLv3, and you are free to use the tweak under those
terms and modify it, I have additional requirements for submitting to this
repository so I retain some control over the licensing if I choose to change it
in the future.

When adding a copyright statement, please include the following statement
whenever possible:

    <Description of file and what it does>
    Copyright (c) <year> <your name>, All Rights Reserved

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

    Additionally, Isaac Trimble-Pederson is granted an additional right to
    sublicense this file, or change the license of this file on the official
    Brightify repository at his discretion.

I add the last term here because if at some point the license should be changed,
for instance, different version of the GNU General Public License or a different
license entirely, I want there to be as little conflict as possible. I will try
to reach out to contributors if I make such a choice, but it's almost certain
that some contributor may lose contact and not be able to respond to such a
request.

If someone knows a better way that I could do this, and doesn't want to include
the statement, let me know.

## The Process
Whenever you decide to make a contribution to Brightify, try to follow this process:

1. Create a GitHub issue with the issue you have found, whether this be a bug
or feature request.
2. Wait for approval to work on the issue.
3. If approved, fork the repository, work on the issue.
4. Submit a pull request to merge the fork in (create your own branch other than
  master or develop, I'd recommend yourusername-branchname).
5. Pull request will be reviewed; we'll discuss if there are any issues.
6. Pull request may be merged into upstream.

### Can't I fork the project?
Of course, you may fork the project. This guide is more intended for people that
wish to contribute code to this repository and to the main distribution of the
tweak.
