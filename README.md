## Features
* Gives your Spotify a light theme, allowing for better daylight visibility.
* Integrates with Noctis for an easy method of toggling the tweak on/off. *
This can be disabled as of v0.3 if you prefer to keep Noctis on but
want Brightify's theme.*

## Compatibility
Compatible with iOS 10.x Yalu102 jailbroken iPhones. *May be compatible with
iPad.*

Compatible with the latest Spotify.

Compatible with ColorFlow 3. *If you are having issues with Brightify+ColorFlow
it is more than likely ColorFlow's issue due to how my tweak is implemented -
check with ColorFlow's developer before submtting an issue here.*

Tested on iPhone 6s, 10.2, yalu102 b7.

## Development Status
Development of this software has halted, as I am no longer jailbroken, and I
do not intend to rejoin the jailbreak community. If you would like to pick
up the code and maintain it, please let me know, as I would be happy to
assist you.

## Contributing
See CONTRIBUTING.md

## Licensing
This tweak is licensed under the GPLv3+. See COPYING.md for the full terms.

In short:
* You are free to use the tweak for whatever purpose.
* You are free to redistribute the tweak anywhere, including commercially.
* You are free to modify the tweak for any purpose
* You are free to redistribute a modified version of the tweak anywhere,
including commercially.

Under the following conditions:
* You must disclose the source code of any version of the tweak, modified or
unmodified, to anyone who you share the binary form of the tweak.
  * That source code must be licensed under the same license - GPLv3(+) so that
  your users have the same freedoms you do.
  * If you redistribute the tweak verbatim, you can link to this repository,
  otherwise you must link to or include the code for your own version.
* You must include the license and copyright statements for redistributed versions
of the tweak.
* You must state changes made to the tweak (a git commit is really sufficient
  in my opinion, though you can include a changelog if you desire).
* You must retain install instructions, or include new ones if the instructions
change.
* Anywhere you redistribute the tweak must allow all the terms of the GPLv3 to
be met; BigBoss allows these terms to be met as-is so I require the same.

Please also don't release your own version of the tweak as "Brightify" - BigBoss
requires that they be the exclusive major repository hosting the tweak, so
calling a fork of the tweak "Brightify" may lead to issues.

### Why?
Free Software benefits users in general; while I'm certainly not one to require
my software be nonfree (I use iOS!), it provides meaningful benefits for
jailbroken users.

First of all, it's a good idea to allow the source code for a tweak to be inspected,
since tweaks can contain malware and other negative aspects; the ability to see
the source code and build from it is important.

Second of all, since jailbreaking is about customization, the ability to modify
the tweak for your own purposes seems obvious.

Finally, I won't always be able to work on this - if I lose my jailbreak, or other
responsibilities come up, I might not be able to improve the tweak.

For these reasons, I want to make sure that my tweak is free, and that anyone who
decides to use my tweak gets those freedoms for themselves and anyone else that
wants the tweak. The GPLv3 is perfect for this, so I chose that license.
